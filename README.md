# CRDKeychain
Simple straightforward Swift-based keychain access framework for macOS and iOS
## Overview
I recently had a need to create a way to access the macOS and iOS keychain from within a Swift-based app I was developing.  Although there are several extensive libraries out there for this very purpose, I found that they were pretty complex and involved a lot of code.  I needed something that was small and compact and easy to add to any project.  I decided to create my own as a framework that will work in both macOS and iOS projects.
